# Tests

Validation tooling for R scripts generated by the `r-high-fidelity-viz` skill.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validation_rules.md` | Prose description of every rule and how to check it |
| `checklist_auto.R` | Automated validation script — run against any `.R` file |

## Usage

```r
source("tests/checklist_auto.R")

# Validate a single file
validate_script("examples/01_scatter_regression.R")

# Validate all examples
validate_all("examples/")
```

## Rules

The validator checks the 26-point quality checklist from `plan.md` Section 11.
The automated rules cover the mechanically-checkable subset (12 of 26 items).
The remaining 14 items (visual design, insight-driven titles, etc.) require human review.

## CI

Rules are also executed in `.github/workflows/validate.yml` on every push and PR to `main`.
